1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a0 ~ a7 register, a2 register

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
line 45 ~ 46, function f and function g all be inline by compiler

3. At what address is the function printf located?
0x630

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
0x38

5. Run the following code.
	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
a. output : HE110 World
b. i order : 0x00726c64
   57616 no need to change, because it printf by %x , not %s , %s print every character. 

6. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
it will print a2 register value
